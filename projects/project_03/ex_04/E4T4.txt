# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
1. Instance i-066cdf503ec1d70ca (Web Service Instance - C3) is configured to allow users to log in with root credentials over SSH, without having to use a command authenticated by a public key. This increases the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack.
--> SSH access to the web instance should be disabled

2. On this instance, TCP port 5000 is reachable from the internet with a process listening on the port. The process has name ‘python3’, process id 1877, and uses binary /usr/bin/python3.6 (deleted). The instance i-066cdf503ec1d70ca is located in VPC vpc-018448402466f7b54 and has an attached ENI eni-0e9a0b83249b1d6f4 which uses network ACL acl-0525f30cafdb456fd. The port is reachable from the internet through Security Group sg-0a4ddf1ae7b795a57 and IGW igw-04458fe008983c484
--> Port 5000 should only be accessable from the loadbalancer


# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

No. As long the IAM permission is insecure, creating VPC private endpoints for S3 will not prevent the unauthorized access to the S3 bucket.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No. Enabling Server-Side Encription will only encrypt new uploading objects. In order to encrypt the old object, one has to download first and re-upload them.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
The resources will build according to the original templats. This means a rollback to the old, insecure configuration.
