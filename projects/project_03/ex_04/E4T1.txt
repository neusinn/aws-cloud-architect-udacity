# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
Goal is to prevent reaching the WebApp instances ssh port 20 from internet.
- avoid password login on ssh
- restrict sources which are allowed to target WebApp instance
Actions:
1. WebAppSG --> restrict inbound rules 
   WebAppSG --> deney port 22 (ssh); Use System Manager Session Manager instead
2. Web Service Instance - C3 --> move to private network

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
- Restrict policy to least priviledge access
