# Excercise 4

## Note to the reviewer:
This account contains a lot of other student projects.
Enabling the AWS security tools show, that there are a lot of bad practices and potential security flwas in these projects. 

With the inspector it was easy to filter to the instances of the Udacity project 3. 
In contrast, AWS Confit and AWS SecureHub show a mor global view. So in order to find the findings belonging to to this project a drill down of the different findings was done. 
Unfortunatly the screenshot will not reflect this analysis adaequatly. 

To resolve these other findings has to be done but is out of scope of this project.
