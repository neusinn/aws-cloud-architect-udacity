--> 

B) Security Hub
WebAppSG        CIS.4.2 Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389
WebAppSG        CIS.4.1 Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
AttackInstanceSG CIS.4.1 Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
S3              S3.4	S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled
EC2             SSM.1	EC2 instances should be managed by AWS Systems Manager

C) AWS Config Dashboard
S3 bucktes Server-Side_encryption is not enabled
--> enable Server-Side_encryption

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
