# Projects 

## Project 01 - Recoverability in AWS
In this project, you will build a multi-availability zone, multi-region database. You will demonstrate how applications can use this distributed infrastructure and migrate your primary database from one geographical region to another. You will also create a versioned website and demonstrate how it is protected from accidental or malicious disruption, with an ability to turn-back-the-clock when something disrupts your normal operations.

## Project 02 - Design, Provision, and Monitor AWS Infrastructure at Scale
In this project, you will plan, design, provision, and monitor infrastructure in AWS using industry-standard and open source tools. You will practice the skills you have learned throughout the course to optimize infrastructure for cost and performance. You will also use Terraform to provision and configure AWS services in a global configuration.

## Project 03 - Securing the Recipe Vault Application
In this project, you will deploy and assess a simple web application environment’s security posture. You'll have a chance to test the security of the environment by simulating an attack scenario and exploiting cloud configuration vulnerabilities. You’ll also set up monitoring to identify suspicious behavior and vulnerable configurations and you will remediate the identified misconfigurations. Finally, you will tie it all together by proposing a DevOps build pipeline that includes security best practices.
